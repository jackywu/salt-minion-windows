Dumpstate v0.2
==============

Dumpstate is a debug utility for the NSIS installer scripting system.
Dumpstate has only been tested with NSIS version 2. I can't think
of any reason that it wouldn't work under NSISv1, but you'll have
to try it for yourself.

I'd appreciate any positive or negative feedback you might have
regarding dumpstate. My email address can be found at my homepage:

  http://www.sullust.net/

Changes since v0.1
==================

Version 0.1 had issues with variables holding more than about 1000
bytes. These have been fixed.

Using Dumpstate
===============

Place dumpstate.dll into your NSIS plugins directory (under the
directory you installed NSIS into), and call it as follows inside
your script:

	Dumpstate::debug

Dumpstate brings up a dialog which allows you to view and alter
variables and the stack. The Up, Down, Add and Del buttons add,
delete and move elements around in the stack. You can also double
click on any variable or stack element to edit it's value.


Building Dumpstate from source
==============================

There's a Makefile for Visual Studio's nmake in the src directory. 
Edit the TARGETDIR macro to point to your NSIS plugins directory
(on my system it's C:\Program Files\NSISv2\Plugins) and run
"nmake" in the src directory to compile.

I haven't tried to compile it using anything other than Visual
C++. Please drop me a line if you do.
